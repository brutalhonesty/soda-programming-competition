Info
-----
Our team placed 1st in the competition. Our submissions are within the ```src``` directory. The ```images``` directory is for the problem set questions.

Question 1 was submitted but not graded at the end. Because we were ahead of the second place team by one submission, the judges opted not to bother checking it.

Question 3, according to the judges did not end up working on either of our 2 submissions but [aji](https://github.com/aji) is pretty certain it works.

Question 4 was unanswered as we ran out of time.

Question 8 also failed but probably due to a small bubble sort implementation error.
